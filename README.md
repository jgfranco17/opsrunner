## Introduction

### About

OpsRunner is a powerful, user-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool tailored for
CI/CD pipelines and build management. Designed to simplify the orchestration of complex
build processes, OpsRunner offers a structured and reliable alternative to traditional
scripting. By leveraging project specifications defined in YAML files, this tool empowers
developers to streamline repetitive tasks and enhance automation across various
environments.

Whether you're running a local build or deploying to production, OpsRunner makes it easier
to achieve consistency, traceability, and scalability in your workflows.

To download the CLI, an install script has been provided.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgfranco17/opsrunner/main/install.sh | bash
```

They always say not to just blindly run scripts from the internet, so feel free to examine
the file first before running.

> [!NOTE]
> This CLI is still an alpha prototype.
