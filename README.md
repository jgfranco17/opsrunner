## Introduction

### About

OpsRunner API is a lightweight SaaS tool designed to continuously test API availability
and correctness. With a simple configuration, users can define their API endpoints,
expected HTTP status codes, and response times, ensuring their services remain operational
without manual monitoring.

### API

Check out the [documentation page](https://jgfranco17.github.io/opsrunner-api/) for more
information about using the API.

### CLI

To run OpsRunner locally, we also provide a CLI tool. This allows you to run your API tests
llocally (from your local machine) or remotely (via request to the API).

To download the CLI, an install script has been provided.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgfranco17/opsrunner/main/install.sh | bash
```

They always say not to just blindly run scripts from the internet, so feel free to examine
the file first before running.

> [!NOTE]
> This CLI is still an alpha prototype.
